# Space-Invaders
PLEASE SCROLL DOWN AND READ THIS - A HUMBLE REQUEST FROM SUDO-NIKHIL
This is game with GUI made using the modules in Pygame.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.8.0 or above (NOT PYTHON 3.9 AS IT HAS PROBLEMS WITH PYGAME) I would suggest u to click on this link (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-amd64.exe) and run the installer. While installing, make sure to check the checkbox which says 'Add python to path'
2. Pygame - Open cmd/terminal and type `pip3 install pygame` (If it says "command not recognized or something", then it is becuz u did not do the above step correctly.)
  If you see ouput such as installing and finally installed, then u are good to go :)
# How to play?
You should find a file named start_game.bat(it is a batch file for windows), and double click on it. This will open the game!
 # Controls
 Arrow left and arrow right for movement.
 Spacebar for shooting.
 # Updates
 Now lets say I added some new features and stuff, just run the "update_game.bat" file (just double click it)
 The above thing is for noobs. Basically the batch script runs the command `git pull`
# Contribution
  Make meaningful changes and send PRs!! :)
  Feel free to ask me for new features.
# Thank you
