# Space-Invaders
A game with GUI made using the modules in Pygame.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.8.0 or above (NOT PYTHON 3.9 AS IT HAS PROBLEMS WITH PYGAME)
2. Pygame - Open cmd/terminal and type `pip3 install pygame` (If it says "command not recognized or something", then uninstall python and re-install (make sure to check ADD TO PATH during installation)
  If you see ouput such as installing and finally installed, then u are good to go :)
# How to play?
You should find a file named Game.py, and double click on it or open a terminal in that location and type `python Game.py`
You will get a GUI!!
 # Controls
 Arrow left and arrow right for movement.
 Spacebar for shooting.
# Contribution
  Make meaningful changes and send PRs!! :)
